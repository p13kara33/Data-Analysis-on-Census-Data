Data analytics algorithms on a census dataset.

For this project, there are folders and each one of them contains a task. 

Descriptive analytics: Graphs and Tables that describe each Column. 
                        Graphs Heatmaps Boxplots choropleth maps and tables that contribute to a more detailed understanding about the dataset
                        

Clustering: The KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms were applied on the dataset.

Classification: Predicting one of the categorical attributes of the dataset using Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.

Association Rule Mining: Here the FP-growth algorithm was applied.

Regression: For predicting the only numerical attribute of the algorithm, Linear and Logistic Regression were applied.
